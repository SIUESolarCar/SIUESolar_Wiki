## Introduction

This space is dedicated to the Electrical Team and all systems that bring the SIUE Solar Car to life. It serves as a shared space to document designs, lessons learned, and development progress across every part of the electrical system.

The goal is to build collective knowledge so that future team members can understand not just what was done, but why decisions were made. Use this documentation to capture both successes and challenges, helping the next generation of the team improve, innovate, and continue advancing the car’s electrical design.
